The code in this module may be instructive in the use of the Entity API (entity) 
module.  Hopefully the comments within the code are sufficient to help you 
understand how the Entity API can be used.

The module can be installed in any Drupal 7 instance and enabled just like any
other contributed module.

Note that the donors.txt file is a list of generated names that was used to 
anonymize the actual donors database table for the purposes of public demos. It
can be safely ignored.
